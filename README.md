# Snake and Mouse game by vo1d.null
 
This is a Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game consists of a snake and a mouse, and the objective is to guide the snake towards the mouse so that it can eat it and grow longer. The player can control the direction of the snake using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

The game keeps track of the score, which is the length of the snake. When the snake collides with the mouse, its length is increased, and the mouse is randomly placed in a new location. If the snake collides with itself or the boundary of the game window, the game ends.

The code consists of three classes: Mouse, Snake, and Game. The Mouse class handles the movement and rendering of the mouse, while the Snake class handles the movement and rendering of the snake. The Game class initializes the game and handles the game loop, collision detection, and score display.

The code also includes functions for rendering the background, playing sound effects, and showing the game over screen.
